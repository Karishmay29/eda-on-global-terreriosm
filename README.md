Overview:
This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global terroirs.
Terroir refers to the environmental conditions, especially soil and climate, in which grapes are grown and that give a wine its unique flavor and aroma. Understanding terroir is crucial in viticulture and winemaking as it directly impacts wine quality and characteristics.

                                          Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA is performed using Python programming language and its popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The analysis includes:


Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.

Data Visualization: Exploring relationships between different attributes using visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

Statistical Analysis: Calculating summary statistics, correlation coefficients, and performing hypothesis testing where applicable.

Insights and Interpretations: Drawing insights from the analysis and identifying key factors influencing terroir characteristics.

                                                           Dataset
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) contains the following features(Atributes).

Features:

Event Date: Date of the terrorist attack.

Country: Country where the terrorist attack occurred.

Region: Geographical region of the country.

City: City where the terrorist attack occurred.

Latitude and Longitude: Geographic coordinates of the location of the terrorist attack.

Attack Type: Type of attack (e.g., bombing, armed assault, assassination).

Target Type: Type of target (e.g., business, government, military).

Weapon Type: Type of weapon used in the attack.

Casualties: Number of casualties (both fatalities and injuries) in the attack.

Group Name: Name of the terrorist group responsible for the attack.

                                                              Analysis
The EDA focuses on exploring various aspects of global terrorism, including:

Temporal trends in terrorist attacks.

Geographic distribution of attacks.

Analysis of attack types, target types, and weapon types.

Identification of terrorist groups responsible for the most attacks.

Examination of casualties and fatalities.

                                                          Results
The EDA revealed valuable insights about terrorism, including the top affected countries, reason of attacks, regions, states, cities, attacking modes, targets,  and chosen weapons. 
The results can help the government in understanding the patterns and areas of terrorism worldwide.
